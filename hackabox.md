### Hack-A-Box - UX201
#### Improving the usability and accessibility of a box

#### **Focus of the box**
We were asked to "hack-a-box" and think of it differently than your traditional box.

The primary focus for our box, was having a user-centered design, and put accessibility features first. The main needs of our users are to be able to carry, open and close the box with next to no difficulty.

#### **Area of interest**
We will be creating a delivery box that is sustainable, economical, functional, ergonomic, and inclusive. Our goal is to create an accessible box by using a human-centered design approach and process.

My connection to "hacking" a box towards people with disabilities, is my work as a camp counselor. I work with kids with different types of mobility disabilities. I wanted to look at different and easier ways people can carry a box.

#### **Achieving our design**
Putting different types of handles on our box allows users with limited mobility and/or strength to be able to lift and carry the box.

We'd also introduce braille labels to put on the box, to allow our visual impaired users the independence to know this is their package.

Inside the box we'd put a layout grid, for repurposing the box to make it more cost-efficient and waste-reducing.

#### **Materials**

We are repurposing materials we already have to make our prototype. Our materials are divided into three categories: Tools, Paper and Embellishments.

The tools we will be using to construct our delivery box are glue guns, liquid glue, scissors, and tape. Our paper materials are of cardboard, cardstock, and construction paper. Our embellishments include a variety of stickers, wire, pens, and string.

Our finished prototype will be on a smaller scale, than the actual product.


#### **Challenges and Reactions**
We experienced a few minor technical challenges when developing our prototype. We would’ve created an even better prototype if we didn’t limit ourselves on our time.

We would’ve liked to have put more thought into the box and incorporated more things or incorporated them differently.

Lack of a concrete plan made it that we didn't use our time to the full potential.

Our audience was well receptive of our box. One question was asked about what paint we used? That would affect how recyclable it was, they misunderstood the paint was only on the prototype.

#### "The idea for this prototype seems innovative, and the intended purposes... appears to be relevant to real-world challenges"
